= Configure External Diff Tool

When you have to solve conflicts in git. You normally would see the conflict marked in the same file but in
a cumbersome to edit it by hand. 

So it is better to have a graphical user interface that helps in identifying the changes and do it graphically.
The purpose of this document is to setup such a tool to use inside the git command tool in the terminal.

As a reference of merge conflicts situations, take a look into https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts[Understanding merge conflicts^].

== Configuring Git Merge Tool
In this section we will indicate the steps to make the 'git client' to use the external tool in order to resolve merge conflicts in a
confortable way.

First step is to indicate git tool which will be the external diff merge tool. Open a `git bash` terminal and type the following.

[source,terminal]
----
$ git config --global merge.tool p4merge
----

This will add an entry key in the global `git bash` configuration settings file.

Now it is time to indicate `git bash` what is the external path to use to associate to the `merge.tool`.

[source,terminal]
----
$ git config mergetool.p4merge.path "C:\Program Files\Perforce\p4merge.exe"
----

[NOTE]
====
Notice the path is expressed in the *Operating System* specific syntax.
====

Now that we have the merge tool `git bash` will use to resolve conflicts in a more visual way, it is time to see it in action.

[source,terminal]
----
$ git mergetool
----

[NOTE]
====
To have a visual cue of the Visual Merge Tool in action, I followed the tutorial steps in https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/using-branches/merge-conflicts[Understanding merge conflicts^].
====

Now if you execute the command `git mergetool`, *_git_* will execute the external configured merge tool, by showing the following screenshot.

[TIP]
====
If you need more information about how to use the '*Visual Merge Tool*' you can open the help menu in the program which leads to the following link 
https://www.perforce.com/perforce/r20.1/manuals/p4merge/Content/P4Merge/diff-merge.p4merge.html[P4Merge Help^]. Notice that it is best to open the
link from within the program as it may change the version.

.Visual Merge Tool (Resolve git Conflict)
image::./git/007-visual-merge-tool-resolve-git-conflict.png[Visual Merge Tool (Resolve git Conflict),700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

[NOTE]
====
As per the tutorial, the conflict is in the file '*_merge.txt_*' file, to which git creates the following files underneath to pass them to the 
'*Visual Merge Tool*' in order to accomplish its task.

* merge_BACKUP_707.txt
* merge_REMOTE_707.txt
* merge_LOCAL_707.txt
* merge_BASE_707.txt
====

After you have resolved the conflict, you must save the changes in the tool.

[CAUTION]
====
After you have resolved the conflicts and saved the changes it will tell `git` that the conflict was resolved. But a copy of the original conflict
was created by the '*Visual Merge Tool*' which needs to be removed before commiting the mergeed versions.
====

If you have more than one file in conflict, it will open the '*Visual Merge Tool*' for each of the conflict files and you repeat the steps described to solve the conflicts, after all of the conflicts are resolved you simply add a commit to finish the merge process to indicate the conflicts were
resolved.
