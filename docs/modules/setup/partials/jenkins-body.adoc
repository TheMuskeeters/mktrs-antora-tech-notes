== Setup
The first thing to do is to download the software to be installed. It is recommended
that you grab the *Generic Java package (.war)* file in the Long-term Support (LTS) section.

Once you have downloaded the *Generic Java package (.war)* open a shell window 
to execute.

[source,bash]
----
$ cd /path/to/war/file
$ java -jar Jenkins.war --httpPort=7000 <1>
----
<1> Use this War file if not using a *_Docker_* image.

The first time it will run a setup process it will show application log in 
the terminal to see.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This magic number shown in screen varies in your installation, notice as well that a file with that
number was created in path shown in picture. Folder path is in Windows format, adjust to your Operating
System accordingly.
====

Now you can go to http://localhost:7000 to continue with the configuration. The first time you access the
site it will ask you for the secret number generated in the last step.

[NOTE]
====
All shown suggested Plugins must be successfully installed. Reject if they are not compatible with the *_Jenkins_* installation you are trying to configure.

Now it is time to register the super important rood admin user. Keep in mind that if you lose these 
credentials then the system may be void, unless you have more admin users set.
