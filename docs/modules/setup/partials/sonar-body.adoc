== Setup
The first thing to do is to go to the official site 
https://www.sonarqube.org/[SonarQube^].

Download the latest release for the community version.

you can go to the following link and there you can download an archived version.

After the download is finished, you will have a ZIP file, unarchive it to any
place you like and remember that location as it will be the 
place where we  will execute the next steps.

Before we launch the *_Sonarqube_* server we must consider changing some default values may you need it.
Go to the location you have unarchived the software and go to the *_conf_* and open in your editor the file *_sonar.properties_*,
locate the following properties (they are marked as comment indicating that they are defaults)

[source,properties]
----
sonar.embeddedDatabase.port=9092 <1>
sonar.web.port=9000 <2>
sonar.search.port=9001 <3>
----
<1> Port used for embedded H2 (used for demostration purposes, configure a real database such as *_MySQL_*, consult *_SonarQube_* documentation). The 9092 is the default value, here it is changed to  4502.
<2> Port used as the gateway to user to connect to *_SonarQube_* server. The 9000 is the default value, here it is changed to 4500.
<3> Port for Search Engine used internally by *_SonarQube_*. The 9001 is the default value, here it is changed to 4501.

Save the file and now it is time to run the *_SonarQube_* server. Go to where you unarchived the software and locate the *_bin_* directory
and select the the folder that matches your operating system, open a command line interface terminal and run the script named *_StartSonar.bat_* 
(in Windows), or *_sonar.sh_* in Unix-like operationg systems.

.SonarQube Start Up

Wait until the console output indicates that server is up.

Open an internet browser to access *_SonarQube_* web interface, and locate its 
*Login* button, click on it and use the Admin/Admin credentials.
Remember to use *http://localhost:4500* to access this web interface.

[NOTE]
====
The default credentials are for the full administrator of the system, it is advised you change it as soon as possible.
====

When setting up the server for the very first time and in Admin mode, the system allows you to use a two minute tutorial to make you up and runnig
with the server (using the default *_Quality Profiles_* and *_Quality Gate_*).

.SonarQube Two Minute Tutorial

If you consider that you need to skip the tutorial, use the link at the bottom. Set the name for the token. As shown (or anything you like) and
click the *_Generate_* button.

[WARNING]
====
Write down that token name and the generated token somewhere as it will not be shown to you again as the note in the screen shows. You can grant
or revoke it later in the administrative pages. We will use this token later when analyzing a Maven Java Project.
