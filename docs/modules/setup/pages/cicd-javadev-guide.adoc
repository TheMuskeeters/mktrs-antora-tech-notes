[WARNING]
====
When you get the proposed install versions for the software you may encounter
that the *LATEST* is greater than the one shown here, this is because
software changes to add new features or bug fixes.

It is recommended to use the *LATEST* and *greatest*
====

Here you find the step by step process for creating a local environment using
*_CICD_* practices.

== Create Spring Boot App
Here the process is simple as we assume you know how to create a basic 
*Spring Boot* using the best starter link ever 
link:https://start.spring.io/[Start Spring IO^].

.Spring Boot Initializr
image::001-spring-initializr.jpg[Spring Boot Initializr,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Generate the project and extract downloaded zip file. This way we have the 
initial project configuration.

[CAUTION]
====
Eventually this code would be pushed to a *_Git_* repository. Use your
favorite IDE to edit files and continue with the tutorial.

A copy of this code is in the link:https://github.com/cortizqgithub/tutorial-cicd-jenkins-sonar[Tutorial CICD Jenkins Sonar^] git repository.

====

== Configure Jenkins
Here we are going to document only the necessary steps required for our setup to properly work.

[NOTE]
====
The assumption here is that you already configured *_Jenkins_* using the Docker image or the standalone WAR 
file (remember that *_Jenkins_* requires *_JDK 8_*).
====

In this document we are going to use the *_Dockerized_* version of *_Jenkins_*. 
Please refer to the Docker INSERT LINK REFERENCE HERE section for details.
We need to know what it is installed in the *_Docker_* image, to do so, 
type the following command to access the command line interface for such image.

[source,terminal]
----
$ docker ps <1>
$ docker exec -it <container_name>|<container_id> /bin/bash <2>
----
<1> To gather the _container_name_ or _container_id for the *_Docker_* image.
<2> To access the container command line interface.

As we built our sample application using *_Java 8_*, *_Spring Boot_* and *_Maven_*, 
we need to guarantee them inthe *_Docker_* image.

[source,terminal]
----
$ java -version <1>
$ git --version <2>
$ mvn --version <3>
----
<1> Java verification. If it works we know it has JDK installed (and it must as it is a requirement 
for *_Jenkins_*). We need *_JDK 8_* and in fact it uses _OpenJDK 1.8.0_181_, which it is 
already installed in *_Docker_* image.
<2> Git verification. If it works then we can use it for the sake of pulling source code in the *_Jenkins_* pipeline,
otherwise it needs to be installed *NOTE:* It is present in the *_Docker_* image.
<3> Maven verification. If it works then we can use it for the sake of building our source code, otherwise it needs to be installed.
*NOTE:* This is not present in *_Docker_* image, so we need to install it.

As the last verification fails for *_Maven_* we must proceed to guarantee it is present in the *_Docker_* image.
To do so, there are two ways, one is to let *_Jenkins_* set it up, or in the *_Docker_* image  command line
interface install it by hand. In this guide we will follow the *_Jenkins_*, which we describe next.

== Build Pipeline
In order to run the *_Jenkins_* pipeline for this guide, there are some other plugins to be installed.
Select the _Manage Jenkins Plugins_ as shown below.

.Jenkins Manage Plugins
image::./jenkins/012-manage-plugins.png[Jenkins Manage Plugins,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Next select the _Available_ plugins and use the filter (search) option to search for these plugins.

.Jenkins Plugin JaCoCo
image::./jenkins/013-plugin-jacoco.png[Jenkins Plugin JaCoCo,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

.Jenkins Plugin SonarQube Scanner
image::./jenkins/014-plugin-sonarqube-scanner.png[Jenkins Plugin SonarQube Scanner,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

.Jenkins Plugin Build Pipeline
image::./jenkins/015-plugin-build-pipeline.png[Jenkins Plugin Build Pipeline,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

TIP: Use the latest version for plugin at the moment besides the names may also differ.

Once they are selected, use the *_Install without restart_* button.

.Jenkins Installing Plugins
image::./jenkins/016-plugin-installing.png[Jenkins Installing Plugins,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

CAUTION: It is necessary to restart in order to use these plugins, do it now.

== Configure Maven in Jenkins
include::partial$global-tool-config.adoc[]

Next locate the *_Maven_* section.

.Jenkins Maven Setup
image::./jenkins/011-install-maven.png[Jenkins Maven Setup,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

To achieve what is shown in the picture above you must click the *_Add Maven_* button and set as the image depicts.

NOTE: Select the version that is more convenient according to your project.

Next click the *_Save_* to finish and this way you have maven setup.

== Configure SonarQube Scanner
After all required plugins are installed in the previous section, we need to install the SonarQube Scanner.

include::partial$global-tool-config.adoc[]

Next locate the *_SonarQube Scanner_* section.

.Jenkins Install SonarQube Scanner
image::./jenkins/019-install-sonarqube-scanner.png[Jenkins Install SonarQube Scanner,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

To achieve what is shown in the picture above you must click the *_Add SonarQube Scanner_* button and set as the image depicts.

NOTE: Select the version that is more convenient according to your project.

Next click the *_Save_* to finish and this way you have maven setup.

== Configure SonarQube
-----ZZZZZ TODO


== Build a Pipeline
A pipeline in Jenkins is the recipe of tasks it needs to execute, sequentially or in parallel. In this
section we are going to define our sample pipeline for demostration purposes.

Login to *_Jenkins_* and click the _Create new Jobs_ or New Item.

.Jenkins Create new Jobs
image::./jenkins/017-create-new-jobs.png[Jenkins Create new Jobs,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

The next step is to declare the type of project we are going to build. Here we create a folder style
as a container for steps in the pipeline.

.Jenkins Job Free Folder Style
image::./jenkins/018-create-new-folder-style.png[Jenkins Job Free Folder Style,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

In the name of the project write _JavaDemo_.
When you go back to main page, you will be presented with the following screen.

.Jenkins Folder Setup View
image::./jenkins/020-job-setup-folder.png[Jenkins Folder Setup View,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

[NOTE]
====
Notice the *_Sun_* in the second column, this will show you the status of the project, when in the *_Sun_* icon, 
it means that the project is healthy, and it is based in the last five executions of the job.
====

The next step  is to configure the steps for the pipeline. Click in th *_Java Jenkins/Sonar Demo_* and 
it will show the following screen.

.Jenkins Sonar Home
image::./jenkins/021-java-jenkins-sonar-home.png[Jenkins Sonar Home,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Next you must create a new item to be associated in the container. For this purpose locate the *_New Item_* in
the menu. And in the choices for new items select the *_Freestyle project_*, and select *Ok*.

.Jenkins Checkout Code
image::./jenkins/022-checkoutcode.png[Jenkins Checkout Code,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Next it is time to configure how to access the source code, which will be made by *_Git_*.
First define what is the URL where the code will be pulled from.

Click in the *_Source Code Managemente_* tab link.

.Jenkins Checkout Code URL
image::./jenkins/023-checkoutcode-url.png[.Jenkins Checkout Code URL,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Next click in the *_Build Triggers*_, this will schedule execution every 15 minutes.

.Jenkins Checkout Code Build Triggers
image::./jenkins/024-checkoutcode-buildperiodically.png[Jenkins Checkout Code Build Triggers,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

At this point click in *_Apply_* and then *_Save_* buttons which lead you to here.

.Jenkins Checkout Code Project View
image::./jenkins/025-checkoutcode-project-view.png[Jenkins Checkout Code Project View,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Next click in the *_+_* button to define more steps. Here we are going to add the *_Pipeline_* View.

.Jenkins Pipeline View
image::./jenkins/026-pipeline-view.png[,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

And in the settings form put the following values (only one shown).

.Jenkins Pipeline View Config
image::./jenkins/027-pipeline-view-config.png[Jenkins Pipeline View Config,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

This way in the project home a new tab appears to show the *_Pipeline_*, as shown next.

.Jenkins Link to Pipeline
image::./jenkins/028-link-to-pipeline.png[Jenkins Link to Pipeline,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Next we create the next step in the pipeline. Select the *_New Item_* when you are in this following
screen.

.Jenkins Compile Step 
image::./jenkins/029-project-compile-start.png[Jenkins Compile Step,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Next we define the type of project.

.Jenkins Compile Step Type Definition
image::jenkins/030-project-compile-type-definition.png[Jenkins Compile Step Type Definition,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Click *_Ok_* to define the settings for task and then click on tab *_Build Triggers_* and configure as shown 
next.

.Jenkins Compile Build Triggers
image::jenkins/031-project-compile-buil-triggers.png[Jenkins Compile Build Triggers,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Next click the tab *_Build_*, click in the *_Add build step_* which will present a list of choices and the
one to select is *_Invoke top-level Maven targets_* which will lead to the following settings.

.Jenkins Compile Build Settings
image::./jenkins/032-project-compile-maven-definiton.png[Jenkins Compile Build Settings,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

And select the *_Advanced_* button and in the *_POM_* field set the path for the source code which is 
located under the *_Jenkins_* installation Project Workspace.

And this conclude this job.  Based in these instructions you can create the next job which is to run the
Java App Tests. Here name task as *_test_* and in the similar way for job *_package_*.
