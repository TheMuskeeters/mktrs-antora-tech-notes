= Insomnia

Insomnia is a free cross-platform desktop application that takes the pain out of
interacting with and designing HTTP-based APIs. Insomnia combines an easy-to-use
interface with advanced functionality like authentication helpers, code 
generation, and environment variables.

You can access its web site page at https://insomnia.rest/[Insomnia Web Site^].

screen.

.Insomnia Onboarding
image::insomnia/003-insomnia-setup-onboarding.png[Insomnia Onboarding,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

After you do this process you are presented with the home screen.

.Insomnia Home
image::insomnia/004-insomnia-home.png[Insomnia Home,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Where in the image:

. Indicates the section where you can configure and set you as an user.
. The list of workspaces or document/collections registered in the system.

By default *Insomnia* is installed with a _Document_, which allows to design
your *API* named *_Swagger Petstore 1.0.2_* and a _Collection_ which allow to 
place your *Ã„PI* requests named *_Insomnia_* as it is shown in the image above.

Here you can create request collection or design an API.
Most of the time as developers we use this tool as a *Request Collection* and as 
such this document focuses in explaining how to create a request and setting up
the environment variables.

[NOTE]
====
There are a lot of features that the application has and it will not be covered
here.
====

== Using Insomnia
Let's begin our journey by creating a new _Collection_. To do so, locate the
button *_Create_*

.Insomnia Create Collection
image::insomnia/005-insomnia-create-collection.png[Insomnia Create Collection,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Then it shows up a dialog to name the *request* collection, for the purpose of 
this document it is named *Teach Insomnia*.

.Insomnia Create Collection Set Name
image::insomnia/006-insomnia-create-collection-teach.png[Insomnia Create Collection,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

You will see a place to start working with your *request* collection.

.Request Collection Workspace
image::insomnia/007-insomnia-worskpace-teach.png[Request Collection Workspace,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

[NOTE]
====
As we need to explain how to create *Environment* settings for a request, 
this guide uses a *Spring Boot* generated app in order to simulate environments
for a *request*.

The named environments will be *LATEST*, *STAGE*, *LOAD*, *PROD* which are a
typical environments which a developer needs to test its *API*.
====

The endpoint we will be using is the following:

[source,bash]
----
$ curl 'http://localhost:8080/api/v1/hello/say/LATEST' \ <1> <2>
  --compressed
----
<1> http://localhost:8080 is the host, port for the endpoint, an environment 
variable is set around this.
<2> *LATEST* is the parameter we pass to the endpoint to indicate that it knows
which environment was sent. This is configured via an environment variable.

Notice that we use here a command line util to request data over *HTTP* in 
terminal window. In insomnia you can create a new *request* by importing that
command and it will take care of registering it into the system in their 
constituent parts as query parameters, headers, etc.

In what follows, we will convert that *URL* to use environment configuration to
allow it to be used for different environments as mentioned earlier.

=== Creating a request
Let's create our first *request*. Click in the button *New Request* or use the 
keyboard setting for that depending on your operationg system. 

[NOTE]
====
It is left to you to read the documentation of the *Insomnia* application to
find the different ways to create a *request*.
====

The following appears

.Create New Request
image::insomnia/008-insomnia-create-new-request.png[Create New Request,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Here you name it whatever you like, for this example it is named as 
*_Retrieve Hello Message_*, click then in the *Create* button.

The system presents you with a work area where you can start configuring
your *request*. We use here a quick import for that definition.

=== Import Request
Select and copy the curl command we presented before and paste it in the *URL* 
input box for the *request* as shown next.

.Import Request
image::insomnia/009-insomnia-import-request.png[Import Request,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

After the text is there, click in the *Send* button to the left of it, *Insomnia*
will parse your command and configure your *request* in the different constituent
parts as you can see in the various tabs and method verb used.

Now we have a working request.
Next, it is time to configure the environments in order to accomplish our usage
of getting calls to any environment, be it *LATEST*, *STAGE*, *LOAD*, 
*LOCALHOST* or *PROD*.

=== Configuring Environments
In the upper left of the screen you see an option named *No Environment* with a 
down arrow, click on it, a drop down shows up, select the *Manage Environment*
there, a popup window will show.

.Manage Environments
image::insomnia/010-insomnia-manage-environments.png[Manage Environments,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

As indicated, we create all of the sub environments to ease the explanations 
that follow, click in the *+* to create and _Environment_ or _Private Environment_, 
by default it creates an _Environment_. It names is as *New Environment*, by
double-clicking on it, you can rename it, do so for *LATEST*, and repeat the 
process for *STAGE*, *LOAD*, *PROD*, and *LOCALHOST*.

Another nice feature is to give color to the environment. To do so, select
the combobox named *Color* at the top right. Notice other options can be applied
here.

.Color configuration for Environments
[%header,cols="20%, 80%"]
|===
|Environment|Color RGB
|*LATEST*|(0,0,255)
|*STAGE*|(0,190,255)
|*LOAD*|(0,255,0)
|*PROD*|(255,0,0)
|*LOCALHOST*|(0,0,0)
|===

[NOTE]
====
You may use the color you like best.
====

Now that we have our *Sub Environments* created, we now need to populate the
environment variables definitions.

[CAUTION]
====
In what follows, it is necessary to select any of the *Environment* we have
defined in order to let *Insomnia* know to which it is referring to, and to
properly associate *Environment* items. To do so, go to the main window and
in locate the *No Environment* drop-down box and select *Use LATEST* to
activate it.
====

In the *Manage Environment* dialog, you see a section named *Base Environment*, 
which refers to the main area where *Environment* is defined taking values from
any *Sub Environment* section as shown next.

.Manage Environments (Populated)
image::insomnia/011-insomnia-manage-environment-populated.png[Manage Environments (populated),scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

[NOTE]
====
When defining *Environment* items, *Insomnia* uses the *_JSON_* format to 
declare that configuration.
====

Now it is time to declare a way to properly pass a value to the sample *URL*
to the parameter text *_LATEST_*. As this depends on an *ENVIRONMENT*, we start 
to define a variable in the *Base* section with name *_param_* (of course, you 
can name it according to the context in your configuration).

[source,json]
----
{
  "param" : "" <1>
}
----
<1> Define a variable in the *Base* section of the *Manage Environments* dialog.

Notice we left the value as an empty string as we have not defined the reference
in any of the *Sub Environments* sections. Click on the left to use the *LATEST* 
*Sub Environment*, and you see there that an empty *JSON* definition. 

Type the following there

[source,json]
----
{
   "param_env" : "LATEST" <1>
}
----
<1> Repeat the same step for every *Sub Environment*, putting in the value the
name of the *Environment* where it is defined.

[NOTE]
====
As an easy convention to name variables here, observe how we named the *param*
variable. The prefix is the name we wrote in the *Base* section and the suffix
adds the part *_env*, forming the variable as *param_env*.
====

Now that we have it defined in every *Sub Environment*, it is time to return to
the *Base* section to complete the value for the *param Environment* variable.

Position the cursor inside the quotation marks and write *{{ param_env }}* (
notice the double curly braces around it and you may include the space around 
it or not, the application recognizes any form) manually, 
to which *Insomnia* will recognize as a Custom Variable and will denote it 
visually as shown next.

.Edit Variable
image::insomnia/012-insomnia-edit-variable.png[Edit Variable,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

For the cues there

. Shows how *Insomnia* indicates it is a custom variable.
. If you double click over the *param_env* box, it opens this dialog, where
you can edit its properties. Notice it has a *Live Preview*.

Now we are ready to modify the *request* to use this *param* *Environment* variable.

Click in the *Done* button (located at the bottom right corner) to save the changes.

=== Modify Request to use Enivornment Variable
Select the *Retrieve Hello Message* _request_ to load it. Now replace the current
text

[source,txt]
----
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/hello/say/LATEST
----

with the following text

[source,txt]
----
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/hello/say/{{param}} <1>
----
<1> Notice that this refers to the *Environment* variable defined in the *Base* 
section in the *Manage Environments* dialog.

If you hit the *Send* button you will see the execution of this *_request_*, like

.Request with Environment Variable (param)
image::insomnia/013-insomnia-request-definition-data.png[Request with Environment Variable,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

In the last image, pay special attention to the highlighted parts. Now if you
change the *Environment* it uses the value defined to send to the *URL*.

Now you can practice to define a new *Environment* variable named *hellosvc* so
the following image looks like this.

[NOTE]
====
The naming convention used for the *Environment* variables depends on your 
organization or personal preferences on the matter.
====

.Request with Environment Variables (Complete)
image::insomnia/014-insomnia-request-fully-parameterized.png[Request with Environment Variables (Complete),scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Now that you know how to define these *Environment* variables, you can use them 
wherever there is an input in the application.

=== Using Template Tags
There comes a time when you need to use the value computed from another 
*request*. By using a *Template Tag* you can accomplish this task. Let's see
how this is created.

First create another *request* named *Retrieve User* by using the following
definition (import it or create it manually).

[source,bash]
----
$ curl --request GET \
  --url http://localhost:8080/api/v1/hello/extract/user <1>
----
<1> Remember to replace http://localhost:8080 with the *Environment* variable
*hellosvc*.

After you call this *URL* the response it gives us is shown as

[source,json]
----
{
  "id": "73fd70c1-d13b-4316-8266-b60b235a2632",
  "name": "User",
  "surname": "Name"
}
----

And we are interested in retrieving the *id* field and use this as the query 
parameter in the *Retrieve Hello Message* request.

One nice thing that the *Insomnia* application offers is that you can extract
values from *JSON* using a *JSONPath* syntax.

Open the *Manage Environments* to define a new variable named *userId*. As this
is a global *Environment* variable, it is declared in the *Base* section.

Later, position the cursor insde the quotation mark for its value and start 
typing *response* and wait about one second when a popup autocomplete shows up.

.Template Tag Response Body Attribute
image::insomnia/015-insomnia-select-response-body-attribute.png[Template Tag Response Body Attribute,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

After you select it and as this is the first time this *Template Tag* shows next

.Template Tag Response Body Attribute (Properties)
image::insomnia/016-insomnia-response-attribute-properties.png[Template Tag Response Body Attribute,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Where
. When click the orange the popup shown in (2) is presented.
. Popup window to define the properties to use.

In the previous popup window select the *Request* named *GET Retrieve User* 
and in the *Filter (JSONPath or XPath)* type the following.

[source,txt]
----
$.id
----

[NOTE]
====
While you are typing the *JSONPath* expresssion, notice that in the *Live Preview*
the system will evaluate and show the current text.
====

Click *Done* button (bottom left corner) to accept the changes.

[TIP]
====
Remember that you are editing a *JSON*.
====

Now you must see the final definition of this *Template Tag* as shown next.

.Template Tag Response Body Attribute (Complete)
image::insomnia/017-insomnia-response-attribute-complete.png[Template Tag Response Body Attribute (Complete),scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Now that we have completed this definition, you can use in any *request*
wherever an input text can be typed. To ilustrate this, we send a query parameter
in the *Retrieve Hello Message* request.

.Retrieve Hello Message (Compete)
image::insomnia/018-insomnia-retrieve-hello-message-complete.png[Retrieve Hello Message (Compete),scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]
