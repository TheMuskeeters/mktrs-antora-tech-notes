== Troubleshooting

=== WSL VPN Issue
For _Rancher Desktop_ V1.0 it is necessary to use the following configuration 
in order to overcome any problem when connected to a VPN.

For Windows:

Download this https://github.com/sakai135/wsl-vpnkit/releases/download/v0.2.5/wsl-vpnkit.tar.gz
Open a Powershell terminal, navigate to the location where you downloaded the file
And then, execute these commands

Go to the folder where you downloaded that file (do not uncompress) and run
the following commands using a *PowerShell* command.

[source,bash]
----
$ wsl --import wsl-vpnkit $env:USERPROFILE\wsl-vpnkit wsl-vpnkit.tar.gz --version 2
$ wsl -d wsl-vpnkit
$ wsl -d wsl-vpnkit service wsl-vpnkit start
----

[CAUTION]
====
As of _Rancher Desktop_ V1.4.1, this hack is not required.
====

=== Get Installer via WGET
If you find you have no access in browser to the *github.com* domain due to 
employer policies, then use the following workaround.

[TIP]
====
*_Microsoft Windows_* Operating System does not come with *wget* utility and 
needs to be downloaded externally. Following are two resources where to install
this utility.

* https://builtvisible.com/download-your-website-with-wget/[How to download, install and use WGET in Windows^]
* https://eternallybored.org/misc/wget/[Windows binaries of GNU Wget^]

Take into account if your *Windows* machine is 32 or 64 bits.
