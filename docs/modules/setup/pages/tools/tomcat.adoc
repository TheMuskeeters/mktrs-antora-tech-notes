= Tomcat
Apache Tomcat (called *"Tomcat"* for short) is a free and open-source 
implementation of the Jakarta Servlet, Jakarta Expression Language, and WebSocket
technologies. Tomcat provides a *"pure Java"* HTTP web server environment in 
which Java code can run.

Tomcat is developed and maintained by an open community of developers under the
auspices of the Apache Software Foundation, released under the Apache 
License 2.0 license.

For more information visit https://tomcat.apache.org/[Tomcat Page^].

== Configuring
As there are many versions avaiable of *Tomcat*, we need to understand which
one to use in our projects.

For that matter, check the https://tomcat.apache.org/whichversion.html[Apache Tomcat Versions^].

[NOTE]
====
As we are currently using *Java 8* and *11* versions we can use any version
from 8.5.72 and above. 

Here, we use *10.0.12*. The instructions are the same for *8.5.x*, *9.0.x*.

Besides, the instructions are written using a *Microsoft Windows* Operating 
System, so you can expect folder names or other specific commands in this
_Operating System_.
====

The first step is to go to the https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi[Apache Tomcat Download Page].

.Tomcat Download
image::tomcat/001-tomcat-download.png[Tomcat Download,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

When you click you will move the page forward to the following place.

.Tomcat Download Version Selection
image::tomcat/002-tomcat-download-ver-sel.png[Tomcat Download Version Selection,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

[NOTE]
====
You can explore the other choices available, but here we use the indicated 
*ZIP* choice.
====

As this is a *ZIP* file, use any tool to explode its contents. 
Take note of the location you exploded those contents as from now on, this is
considered as the *[TOMCAT_HOME]*, for example, *[TOMCAT_HOME]* is set to 
*'c:\java\apache-tomcat-10.0.12\'*.

Set the following line inside file *_startup.bat_* or *_startup.sh_* in the 
*[TOMCAT_HOME]\bin* folder:

[source,txt]
----
set CATALINA_OPTS="-agentlib:jdwp=transport=dt_socket,address=7999,server=y,suspend=n"
----

You can see a screenshot showing this.

.Tomcat Add Agent Port
image::tomcat/003-tomcat-add-agent.png[Tomcat Add Agent Port,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Using this configuration, you are telling *Tomcat* to expose port 7999 (change 
this number to one that is not used if you get a conflict) in order
to connect to it remotely for debugging purposes.

== Running Tomcat
Now you have the software installed and provided you have the proper *[JAVA_HOME]*
setting configured, you can go to a terminal window (or use a *_BASH_* terminal
in *Windows*) and type the following command.

[NOTE]
====
Go to [TOMCAT_HOME]\bin folder.
====

[source,bash]
----
$ ./startup
----

.Tomcat Startup
image::tomcat/004-tomcat-startup-windows-terminal.png[Tomcat Startup,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

When executing this command it opens up a new window but this time it is for the
Java process.

[NOTE]
====
Here, *Tomcat* is using JRE_HOME for JDK 8, if you need to change this setting, 
you simply change the *[JAVA_HOME]* environment variable.
====

.Tomcat Java Process
image::tomcat/005-tomcat-java-process.png[Tomcat Java Process,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

When you need to stop the server, execute the *[TOMCAT_HOME]\bin\shutdown.bat* (Windows) or
*[TOMCAT_HOME]/bin/shutdown.sh* (Linux) script.

[NOTE]
====
If this does not work, go to the *_Tomcat Java Process_* window and press 
CTRL+C (Windows) to cancel the process (check your key in other _Operating 
System_.
====

Take special care of the following:

[IMPORTANT]
====
Configure the SSL certificates to talk to other systems over HTTPS before 
starting the *Tomcat* instance to the *_JDK_* it is running with. 

See xref:setup:tools/jdk.adoc[JDK]
====

To check that *Tomcat* server is working, open the followng URL in the browser:

----
http://localhost:8080/
----

[NOTE]
====
If you need to change the port to any other available number for your 
configuration or if for some reason it is now used. Open the following file
[TOMCAT_HOME]\conf\server.xml and locate the following entry

[source,xml]
----
    <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1"
               connectionTimeout="20000"
               redirectPort="8443" />

----

Change the *port* value to the one you need.
====

.Tomcat Server Page
image::tomcat/006-tomcat-page.png[Tomcat Server Page,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

[WARNING]
====
To access any of the *Server Status*, *Manage App*, *Host Manager* buttons, 
we need to configure the *Tomcat* Server for administrator users.

To do so, go to *[TOMCAT_HOME]\conf* folder, locate the file *_tomcat-users.xml_*
and add the following before closing the *_</tomcat-users>_*.

[source,xml]
----
<role rolename="admin-gui"/>
<role rolename="manager-gui"/>
<role rolename="manager-script"/>
<role rolename="manager-jmx"/>
<role rolename="manager-status"/>  
<user username="admin" password="admin" roles="manager-gui,manager-script,manager-jmx,manager-status,admin-gui"/>
----

Save the file and restart the server. Now when prompted for the user type
*_admin/admin_*. 

Notice this is valid only for development environment and not for production
environment.

.Tomcat Users Settings
image::tomcat/007-tomcat-users-setting.png[Tomcat Users Settings,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

====

When you use any of the *Server Status*, *Manage App*, *Host Manager* options, 
you can see them in the following (remember to use an allowed user).

== Server Status
With this option you can evaluate the status of the server.
To access this option you need to provide an allowed user (see previous section).

.Tomcat Server Status
image::tomcat/008-tomcat-server-status.png[Tomcat Server Status,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

Explore the options that are presented there.

== Manage App
Here you can get a glimpse of all the applications deployed to the server. 
To access this option you need to provide an allowed user (see previous section).

.Tomcat Manage App
image::tomcat/009-tomcat-manage-app.png[Tomcat Manage App,700,700,scaledwidth=75%,pdfwidth=60%]

[NOTE]
====
If you place any *WAR* (this is the artifact that *Tomcat* server understands 
to properly configure as an application), and if you place this *WAR* into
*[TOMCAT_HOME]\webapps* folder, the server will detect it and it deploys that
artifat to the server.

For example, if the *WAR* is name as *_my-app.war_* and you put into that folder,
then the *Tomcat* server will deploy it and configure that application and 
configures its context such as 'http://localhost:8080/my-app'
====

== Virtual Host Manager
Here you will see the configuration of the running *Tomcat* server, this option
is only available to be viewed with a browser that is running in the same
computer the server is running. To access this option you need to be connected
with an authorized user.

== Sample Application
In order to exercise other topics so you get the full knowlege about how
*Tomcat* server works, let's creat a sample application to ilustrate this
concepts.
