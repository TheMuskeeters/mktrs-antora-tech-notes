= IntelliJ Smart Tomcat

The *SmartTomcat* will auto load the Webapp classes and libs from project and 
module, you needn't copy the classes and libs to the WEB-INF/classes and 
WEB-INF/lib.

The Smart Tomcat plugin will auto config the classpath for tomcat server.
The Smart Tomcat support *Tomcat 6+*.

So here we are going to explain how to install and configure this *IntelliJ* 
plugin.

== Installation
The first thing you need to do is open the *IntelliJ* IDE, for this guide the
version used is _2021.2.3_ or later.

To open the *IntelliJ* _Settings_ dialog, do the following.

* In Windows, navigate to *_File -> Settings_* or press *_CTRL+ALT+S_*.
* In MacOSX, navigate to *_IntelliJ IDEA -> Preferences* or press *_CMD+,_*.

[NOTE]
====
Most of the screenshot captures are taken using the *_Windows_* OS.

Next locate in the options the _Plugins_ choice. Use the search box to locate
it quickly as shown next.

.IntelliJ Settings Plugins

Play special attention that the dialog presents two choices for checking if the
desired *Plugin* is installed or not, notice in the screenshot that it has
two tabs, one named *Marketplace* and the other *Installed*. If the *Plugin*
is not yet installed it means you need to look for it in the *Marketplace*
tab, typing in the search box the name of the *Plugin* you need, in this case,
*Smart Tomcat*.

[NOTE]
====
As indicated in the screenshot, the *_Smart Tomcat_* is already installed, but
if you happen not to have it already installed in your *_InteliJ*, it would
say _Install_, which is the action you should take now.
====

After the plugin is correctly installed then it should appear in the other 
tab mentioned before.

== Configuration
Now that we have the plugin properly configured, let's add a new *_Tomcat_*
configuration.

In your *_IntelliJ_* locate the *_Add Configuration..._* option shown next.

.IntelliJ Add Configuration

[NOTE]
====
If the text is not there it means that you already set a configuration to run,
so clicking in the same place presents you with other choices.
====

And it shows the following dialog.

.IntelliJ Run/Debug Configurations

[NOTE]
====
Scroll down to locate the *_Smart Tomcat_* configuration to add.
====

As you may have guessed, *_Smart Tomcat_* requires to know the location of your
*_Tomcat Server_* so he can proceed to put the artifacts therein.

Notice that here we don't have one defined, so it is now time to declare one as
shown next, click on the *Configuration* button to define one.

.Add Tomcat Server

.Define Tomcat Server

As shown in the previous imaga, there are no servers defined, so click the 
indicated button, where it will ask you the location in your file system where
you have installed/configured your *_Tomcat Server_*.

.Define Tomcat Server Location
