= JDK

== Certificates
When you have installed and configured the *_JDK_*, you then need to install the
SSL Certificate given the environment you need to interact with.

The following instructions can be used only for setting the SSL Certicate for 
the lower environments, namely, *_LATEST_*, *_STAGE_*, *_LOAD_*.

We use the *LATEST* in this document. You can follow this template to replicate
for the other environments, replacing the environment where appropriate.

[TIP]
====
For reference you could use https://www.sslshopper.com/article-most-common-java-keytool-keystore-commands.html[The Most Common Java Keytool Keystore Commands^].
====

Open your web browser, here we will be using *Google Chrome Browser* and point 
to any of the following URLs:

* *LATEST:* https://dclapi-latest.wdw.disney.com/dcl-api/dcl-availability-service/voyages
* *STAGE:* https://dclapi-stage.wdw.disney.com/dcl-api/dcl-availability-service/voyages
* *LOAD:* https://dclapi-load.wdw.disney.com/dcl-api/dcl-availability-service/voyages

You are presented with the following page.

[NOTE]
====
The site we are using here refers to *'DCL API'*, so, we are registering 
the certificates for calls to it.

This will start the export to file process.

.Init Certificate Export

Next you select the file format.

.Certificate Format

Next think of a name for the certificate, lets use here *_latest-cert_*, the system assigns the extension *_cer_*, but you can use whatever name you consider.

.Certificate Select File Name

Then before proceeding to the export the system will provide an overview summary.

.Certificate Export Overview

After you click the *Finish* button it will report a successful export.

Now you must copy or reference the file in the following commands to import 
the certificate to the *_JDK_* you want to use. 

[IMPORTANT]
====
You need to have access rights to the *_JDK_* folder to complete these commands.
====

[NOTE]
====
The *_JDK_* cacerts file is located in the following path.

* $JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security for *_JDK_* 8 and below.
* $JAVA_HOME/lib/security for *_JDK_* 11 and above.

Here *JAVA_HOME* refers to the folder where the *'JDK'* is installed.
====

With the following code you import the certificate to the *_JDK_* cacerts.

[source,bash]
----
$ keytool -import -alias disney-latest-cert -keystore cacerts -file latest-cert.cer
----

[WARNING]
====
When asked for the password, use the default password *changeit*, notice that 
it should be changed if required.
====

[NOTE]
====
In the previous command, notice it uses an alias, *_disney-latest-cert_* and 
here *_latest-cert.cer_* is the file you downloaded.

Besides when you need to supply a password, type the *_changeit_*. When you see
the question "Trust this certificate? [n]:", type *yes*.
====

And if you need to check that the certificate is imported, use the following command.

[source,bash]
----
$ keytool -list -v -keystore cacerts -alias disney-latest-cert
----

If you need to replace a certificate, you must delete it first and add it again.

[source,bash]
----
$ keytool -delete -alias disney-latest-cert -keystore cacerts
----

Finally, you must provide the *_Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited
Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files 8 Download_*. These files can be obtained
from the following link: 
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jce8-downloads.html[JCE Unlimited Strength Download^].

Extract these files and copy them in the _[JAVA_HOME]/jre/lib/security_ folder, 
for JDK 8 distribution.

* _local_policy.jar_
* _US_export_policy.jar_

[WARNING]
====
In Java versions 8u151 and higher, the *JCE* framework uses the unlimited 
strength by default
