Install Node.js Locally with Node Version Manager (nvm)

Node Version Manager - POSIX-compliant bash script to manage multiple active 
node.js versions
https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm

This notes are for nvm V0.38.0

$ nvm list -> Reports installed versions under 'nvm' control.

$ nvm install 14 

Tells nvm to install the latest release for 14 line.

$ nvm install 14.12.0 

Installs the specific version.

$ nvm use 14 -> Switch to this installed version. If there are two or more it
gets the latest version in that branch, e.g., if we have 14.15.4 and 14.17.0 
installed, it will favor 14.17.0 to use. 

$ nvm use system -> Indicates to work with the node version installed via the 
nodejs setup wizard.

$ brew services start postgresql
